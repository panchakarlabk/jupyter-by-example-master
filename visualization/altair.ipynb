    "[Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) is a declarative statistical visualization library, based on the [Vega](http://vega.github.io/vega) and [Vega-Lite](http://vega.github.io/vega-lite) grammar of graphics.\n",

    "Since Altair is based on the Javascript-driven Vega, the internal notebook outputs are a mix of HTML and Javascript. With IPython 7.2.0 (later versions might fix this), a `jupyter nbconvert --execute --to html` call will produce *empty* output cells.\n",

    "To circumvent the problem, you can use HTML pointing to generated PNGs as the code cell output, instead of the Altair chart object itself. This is also more ‘git-friendly’ when you commit output cells, since the binary image data is stored in extra files and does not inflate the diffs for the notebook."
